Abstract:
FinBot – Your AI Financial Assistant is an intelligent, interactive financial guidance system
designed to help users manage their personal finances through automation, analytics, and
conversational AI. Developed using Python, Streamlit, NLP techniques, and Large Language
Models (LLMs), FinBot enables users to receive personalized financial advice, analyze monthly
budgets, classify spending patterns, and plan savings goals through an intuitive and user-friendly
interface.
The system combines natural language processing to understand user queries with AI-generated
insights to deliver tailored guidance based on different personas such as students, working
professionals, and retirees. FinBot processes user-provided income and expense data, calculates
savings, visualizes spending distribution through graphical charts, and evaluates financial health
using custom scoring algorithms. It further categorizes expenses into “needs” and “wants,”
enabling users to identify unnecessary spending and make more informed financial decisions.
The motivation behind FinBot originates from the growing need for accessible and intelligent
financial management tools in a world where individuals often struggle with budgeting,
overspending, and financial planning. Traditional financial advisory services are costly and timeconsuming,
whereas FinBot offers an automated, real-time, and personalized solution that
improves financial literacy and empowers users to take control of their money.
Overall, FinBot demonstrates how modern AI technologies can enhance personal finance
management by providing accurate insights, improving user engagement, and supporting longterm
financial planning. The system is designed to be scalable, extendable, and adaptable for future
integration with mobile platforms, advanced analytics, and AI-driven investment
recommendations.
